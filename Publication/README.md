This's our JavaA final project finished in 5 weeks. Since we are just the freshmen to programming and lack of the methods of Software Engineering also time, it's now a half-finished demo but can run most of the functions. We will continue improve our skills and ability. Hope you can enjoy your time in this game!
BTW: I haven't finished the style-choosing, language-changing and musicbag. If you want to make the surface look nicer, hear your favourate music or using different language, you can just change the image of chess/background, add music into "Classical" or "War" bag, and translate the words in the properties file, wish you have a good time.(The one to add music is simplest).
